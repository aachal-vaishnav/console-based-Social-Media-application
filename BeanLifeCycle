## 🔄 Bean Life Cycle Steps

1. **Instantiation**
   - Spring creates the bean object.

2. **Dependency Injection (DI)**
   - Required dependencies are injected into the bean.
   - Example: Injecting `PostList` into `User`.

3. **Initialization**
   - The bean is fully initialized and ready to use.
   - The `init()` method is executed.

4. **Perform Operations**
   - The application uses the bean to perform business logic.

5. **Destroy**
   - When the Spring container is closed, the bean is destroyed.
   - The `destroy()` method is executed.

## ⚙️ Bean Life Cycle Methods

Spring provides two important lifecycle methods:

### 1️⃣ init()
- Called immediately after the bean is created and dependencies are injected.
- Used to initialize resources.
- Example:
  - Database connection
  - Cache loading
  - Resource setup

### 2️⃣ destroy()
- Called just before the bean is destroyed.
- Used to release resources.
- Example:
  - Closing database connections
  - Releasing memory or streams

## 🌍 Real-World Example (Database Connection)

Suppose you have an application that:
- Displays a user details form
- Takes user input (name)
- Fetches user data from a database after submission

### ❌ Bad Approach
- Create the database connection **after** the user clicks the submit button.
- The user has to wait for the connection.
- This makes the application slow.

### ✅ Good Approach
- Create the database connection **when the application loads**.
- When the user submits the form, data is fetched immediately.
- This improves performance.

👉 In this case, the **`init()` method** is very useful.

## 🧩 XML Configuration Example

```xml
<bean id="user"
      class="com.example.SocialMedia.SimpleUser"
      init-method="init"
      destroy-method="destroy">
    <property name="postList" ref="postList"/>
</bean>
````

---

## 🧑‍💻 Java Class Example

```java
public class SimpleUser implements User {

    String userName;
    PostList postList;

    public void init() {
        System.out.println("Database connection success");
    }

    public void destroy() {
        System.out.println("Close all resources");
    }

    @Override
    public void setUserName(String username) {
        this.userName = username;
    }

    @Override
    public String getUserName() {
        return this.userName;
    }

    @Override
    public void setPostList(PostList postList) {
        this.postList = postList;
    }

    @Override
    public PostList getPostList() {
        return this.postList;
    }
}
```

## 🔚 Closing the Spring Context

```java
context.close();
```

* Closes the Spring container.
* Automatically triggers the `destroy()` method for singleton beans.

---

## ✅ Summary

* Spring Bean Life Cycle:
  **Instantiation → Dependency Injection → init() → Use → destroy()**
* `init()` is used for resource initialization.
* `destroy()` is used for resource cleanup.
* In XML configuration:

  * `init-method`
  * `destroy-method`

---

### 📌 Important Note

* `destroy()` is called for **singleton beans**
* Spring does **not manage destroy methods for prototype beans**
